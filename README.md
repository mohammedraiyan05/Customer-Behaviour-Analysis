## 🏷️ Title
**Customer Behaviour Analysis using Python (Pandas, NumPy) in Google Colab**

---

## ⭐ Executive Summary

### 📍 Business Problem
The company is experiencing increasing customer churn and lacks clear insights into:
- Which customer groups are at high churn risk  
- How demographics impact customer loyalty  
- Whether the loyalty program is effective  
- What factors influence customer retention  

Understanding customer behaviour is essential to improving retention and increasing lifetime value.

### 📍 Solution
A demographic-driven customer analysis was performed using Python.  
This solution includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Churn rate comparisons  
- Loyalty program evaluation  
- Customer segmentation  
- Insights using visualizations  
- Practical business recommendations  

---

### 📍 A Few Next Steps
- Build a machine learning churn prediction model  
- Add purchase history to improve accuracy  
- Create an interactive dashboard (Plotly / Power BI)  
- Implement targeted retention strategies  

---

### 📍 The Numerical Impact

| Metric / Group | Insights |
|----------------|----------|
| **Overall Churn Rate** | ~30% |
| **Loyalty Program Members** | Churn reduced by **40%+** |
| **High Income Customers** | Churn < **8%** |
| **Low Income Customers** | Churn **20–30%** |
| **Membership Years ≥ 3** | Churn only **3–5%** |
| **Young Adults (18–30)** | Highest churn |

These findings guide business decisions to reduce churn and improve retention.

## 📌 Business Problem
The organization needs to understand:
- Why customers are leaving  
- Which demographic attributes drive loyalty  
- Which customers are at high churn risk  
- How personal attributes (income, age, marital status) impact retention  
- How to better target and retain customers  

This analysis provides data-based answers and actionable insights.

## 📌 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Preparation
- Loaded dataset into Google Colab  
- Cleaned and validated fields  
- Created new columns:  
  - Age groups  
  - Family size  
  - Loyalty program binary flag  

---

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visual analysis performed for:
- Gender distribution  
- Churn by gender  
- Churn by age groups  
- Income group churn comparison  
- Loyalty program vs churn  
- Education level distribution  
- Membership years impact  

Used:
- Count plots  
- Bar plots  
- Multi-chart dashboard  
- Box plots

### 3️⃣ Customer Segmentation

| Segment Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **High-Value Loyal** | High income + loyalty program member |
| **Low Income – High Churn Risk** | Low-income churned customers |
| **Long-Term Member** | Membership ≥ 3 years |
| **General Segment** | Other customers |

---

### 4️⃣ Insights Extraction
Each graph was interpreted to identify behavior patterns and churn drivers.
